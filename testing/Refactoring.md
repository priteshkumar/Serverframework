## Refactoring

*It can have below possibilities or more :*

`change variable name`

`change method name`

`split method into smaller ones`

**Advantages**

> Restructuring the code without affecting its functionality

> Makes the code more readable 

> More comprehensible and structured 

>Increases maintainibility of code


**Refactoring Scenarios**

> Change in requirements

> Change in design

> Old piece of code no longer needed/dead code


**What to Refactor**

> Code hard to understand

> Repeated code , e.g. common db queries, mathematical functions

> Variable names/method names to be more descriptive

> Long methods 

> Long classes 


### Refactoring methods

> **Extract class** : reduce long class to smaller by moving some methods/variables to another class

> **Extract variable** : remove hardcoding of repeatedly used primitive value by creating a variable(e.g, static final etc)
