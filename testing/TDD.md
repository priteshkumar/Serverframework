## TDD info

> TDD is a philosophy of stagewise "test little code little" 

> It involves stagewise code development/testing 


## Steps in TDD
`It works on basic principle of write a test case , write code to pass test case`

> write test cases

> writing enough code to pass the test cases

> Making changes to write the code more effectively



## Benefits of TDD

> helps in pseudo documentation

> reduces debugging effort later 

> increases organisation/stability of code at some later point of time

> converting requirements into test cases helps in analyzing design of software before code development
 
 
 ## Requirements of a good testcase 
 
 > it should have high code coverage ( > 95 %)
 
 > multiple assertions for different aspects 
 
 > should be able to catch bugs , if code break occurs later
 
 > testcases should be independent , not dependent on run status of other testcases
 
 > testcases should not share resources , it can lead to random failures.
